// Create a function that takes 3 parameters: a path, a word and a number,
// than it should write to a file.
// The path parameter should be a string, that describes the location of the file.
// The word parameter should be a string, that will be written to the file as lines
// The number paramter should describe how many lines the file should have.
// So if the word is "apple" and the number is 5, than it should write 5 lines
// to the file and each line should be "apple"
// The function should not raise any error if it could not write the file.
