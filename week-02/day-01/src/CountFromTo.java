// Create a program that asks for two numbers
// If the second number is not bigger than the first one it should print:
// "The second number should be bigger"
//
// If it is bigger it should count from the first number to the second by one
// 
// example:
//
// first number: 3, second number: 6, should print:
//
// 3
// 4
// 5
